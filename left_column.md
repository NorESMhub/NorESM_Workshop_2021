<!--
### **Software requirements**

<mark>Please get familiar with the following softwares.</mark>

- Linux Shell: Bash or Csh, etc
    * You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit text files in the terminal.
    * This [Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html) ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI)) contains the essentials.
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/): (chose one of the following)
    * [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.2/nano.html): Easy to start with, but limited functionality
    * [Vim](https://www.openvim.com/): Very capable editor, requires some effort to get started
- Source version control
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com) is version control tool for source code and is already installed in the HPC server during the workshop
    * It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works, but please go through [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/) for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
-   * [Github](https://www.github.com) is for collaborative work for software development and hosts NorESM sources.
